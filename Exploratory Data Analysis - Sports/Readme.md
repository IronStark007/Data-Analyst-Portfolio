# Exploratory Data Analysis - Sports

## Introduction

[Indian Premire League Dataset](https://bit.ly/34SRn3b) (GTD) contains the match descriptions, results, winners, player of the matches, ball by ball dataset and much more from the year 2008-2019.

This dataset consists of two seperate CSV files : matches and deliveries. These files contain the information of each match summary and ball by ball details, respectively.

## Problem Statement

Our goal is to _Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on this dataset_ and __As a Sport Analyst, find out the most successful team and players__.

And __Suggest teams or players a company should endorse for its products__.

## Solution

After loading the dataset in spreadsheet, I have done cleaning and preprocessing by combining both the dataset and change the team names for inconsistency, removing team which are not part of the IPL franchies,null columns and irrelevant data then moved to the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Part using tableau

In EDA, I have analyzed the succesful team, man of the match, top 10 batsman and bolwers and team performance by seasons.

## Conclusion

After fully exploring the data, I have suggested below recommendations:

1. _Mumbai Indians_ (MI), _Chennai Super Kings_ (CSK), and _Kolkata Knight Riders_ (CSK) are __most successful teams__ of the franchies.
2. After 2010, _MI_ showed great performance in the __odd years__, _CSK_ has great performance throughout __all the years__.
3. _Chris Gayle_, _Ab de villiers_ and _Rohit Sharma_ are the __most important players__ in the IPL.
4. _Andre Russell_ , _Sam Curran_ and _Sunil Narine_ have scored __highest run__ in the matches.
5. _Lasith Malinga_, _Amit Mishra_ and _Harbhajan Singh_ have taken __most number of wickets__. 


### Recommendations
The Sport Aanalyst should/can - 
- take into __top priority these three teams__ - MI, CSK & KKR while going for product endorsements.
- consider _Chris Gayle_, _Ab de villiers_ and _Rohit Sharma_ __for most successful ad campaign__.
-  consider _Andre Russell_ , _Sam Curran_ and _Sunil Narine_ while __endorsing any batsman product or ad related__ to them __like stickers in the bat__.
-  consider _Lasith Malinga_, _Amit Mishra_ and _Harbhajan Singh_ for any adverstise __related to bowling or fielding products__.

## Next Steps

Sport or marketing Analyst should take a look into the Women's cricket to find out players which will increase their product sales
