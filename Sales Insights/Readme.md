# Sales Insights

## Introduction

Atliq Hardware is a company which supplies the hardware peripherals to different clients such as nomad stores, excel stores. These are all
the clients and this is a hardware company which will supply computers other peripheral networking equipment to them and they have a head office in let's say
Delhi, India and they have regional offices in different states of India and
The sales are declining for this company and a sales director is having a lot of struggle tracking where the business is failing and the sales director doesn't
have any idea on what is actually happen at a ground level

## Problem Statement

__To unlock Sales Insights that are not visible before for sales team for decision support & automate them to reduced time spend in data gathering__

## Solution 

The dataset is available in [Google Sheets online](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OEJ83m_9Xp08FVnUjzSV7GLiS0iFzkOrRJ36liG-P-0/edit?usp=sharing) 

And I have connected to Google Sheets with the tableau connector as to keep updated the dashboards.

I have made two Dashboards named - Revenue Analysis and Profit Analysis for tracking profit and revenue of the company.

The Insights contains - 
- Revenue by Markets
- Sales Quantity by Markets
- Profit Margin by Markets
- Profit trend by Year
- Revenue by Year
- Top 5 Customers by Profit and Revenue
- Top 5 Products by Profit and Revenue

You can check my [Profit Analysis Here](https://github.com/IronStark007/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/master/Sales%20Insights/Profit%20Analysis.pdf).
## Recommendations

Based on the dashbaords insights, I have made some recommendation that
Sales Marketing team should/can -
1. consider making a sales strategy for especially __lucknow__ since its showing __lowest revenue and negative profit margin__ and if possible so as for __Surat__ and __Bhubhaneshwar__ also.
2. try to __increase its sales quantity__ in __Patna__, __Surat__ and __Kanpur__ since they have lowest sales quantity.
3. start their target campagin for __Prod047__ and __Prod061__ since they __two are the most profitable and most selling products__.
4. try to __give special benefits__ to __Electronics__ and __Excel store_s_ as they are their most __profitable__ customers.
5. make their __campgain strategy for mid year__ as they are showing high sales among other months.
