# Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail
## Introduction

[Sample SuperStore](https://bit.ly/3i4rbWl) is a fictional dataset made for praciticing Data Analysis

## Problem Statement

Our goal is to __Perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the Saample SuperStore dataset and we have to _find out the weak areas where we can work to make more profit_.__

And also __any other business problems we can derive by exploring the data?__

## Solution

I have loaded the dataset and cleaned (preprocess) it  for consistency then moved to the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Part.

In EDA, I have compare the sales with the highest reason to the sales of the lowest region to find out the reason of low sales in the weaker areas.

__Challenges__

The data doesn't contain any dates data so we cant check for how much sales is increase for year or month or weeks.

## Conclusion

After fully exploring the data, I have suggested below recommendations:

#### Insights
1. The _Central_ Region is showing __lowest sales & profit__ ( lower than the avg sales of the country)
2. The profit is less in _furniture_ and _office supplies_
3. The __sales & profit__ of _Tables_ is low in the _Central_ region. Also _Bookcases_ & _Furnishings_ going in loss in _Central_ region
4. The avg. profit of _Home Office_ & _Consumer_ is low in _Central_ Region
5. _Central_ Region is __giving less discounts__ in comparison with _South_ Region (which is the highest sales region)

#### Other Insights
- The ship mode in _same day_ of _South_ Region is making loss 

### Recommendations
- _Superstore_ needs to increase their discounts to boost up the market in the _Central_ Region
- Marketing teams should consider _Furniture_ and _Office Supplies_ Category while thinking about a new Sales campaign
- Also Superstore can start advertising about their _Bookcases_, _Furnishing_, _Tables_ products to the customer from _Home Office_ & _Consumer_ lets say the quality and reliability and give special offer for bulk purchase or Home office kit.

## Next Steps

SuperStore should try to give loyalty points/cards to regular users and can target the segments of specific age group to see how much sales are improving by which age group
