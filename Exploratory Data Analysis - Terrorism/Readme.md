# Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism

## Introduction

[Global Terrorism Database](https://bit.ly/2TK5Xn5) (GTD) is an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2017. 

The GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 180,000 attacks. The database is maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), headquartered at the University of Maryland.
## Problem Statement

Our goal is to _Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on this dataset_ and __As a security/defense analyst, try to find out the hot zone of terrorism__.

## Solution

I have loaded the dataset and cleaned (preprocess) it  by removing many null columns and irrelevant data using python then moved to the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Part using tableau

In EDA, I have checked which country, regions have higher in _Sucessful_ terrorist attack, the year wise trend of the terrorist activities, Which public/private property are most attacked by the terrorists.

__Challenges__

There is lots of missing values in most of the columns which makes it difficult to check all the aspects of terrorism attacks. 

Also since the data is from 1970 to 2017, many countries names are has been changed so consistency issue exists 
(_But I have tried to do the analysis as fair as possible and not missed any single aspects of the data to be invented._) 

## Conclusion

After fully exploring the data, I have suggested below recommendations:

1. _Middle East & North Africa_ and _South Africa_ are the __two most affected region__ due to terrorism.
2. _Iraq_ and _Pakistan_ are the __two most dangerous countries__ in the world by since their success rate of terrorism is high.
3. Terrorist Activities __increases from 1997 onwards__ and it has __reached its peak at around 2014-15__.
4. _Private Citizen & Property_ , _Government_ and _Police_ departments are __most attacked__ by the terrorists.


### Recommendations
The Defense/Security Aanalyst should/can - 
- Revise and increase their defence policy for _Middle East & North Africa_ and _South Africa_ Regions since they are most affected regions.
- impose strict survilience and major alert in _Iraq_ and _Pakistan_ countries so that they can if find any suspicious activity happening, should take immediate actions before any harm happens.
- provide helpline and bomb squad support for every _Private Citizen & Property_ , _Government_ and _Police_ and increase its security policy to maintian the peace.

## Next Steps

Defense Analyst should also took into consider the travelling activies happening in these Regions & Countries to decrease the terrorism.
